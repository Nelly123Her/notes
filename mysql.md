###Â Fix MySQL to use vault as dynamic credentials
A new version of MySQL does it this way
In the new MySQL client, if the password is left empty while installing then, it is based on the auth_socket plugin.

The correct way is to log in to MySQL with the sudo privilege.

steps:
1. sudo mysql -u root -p
And then updating the password using:

1. ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'new-password';


    **Once this is done, stop and start the MySQL server.**

1. sudo service mysql stop
1. sudo service mysql start
